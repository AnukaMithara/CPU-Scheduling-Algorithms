# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms

This is an implementation of scheduling algorithms using Processing. The assignment includes the following scheduling algorithms:

    1. First Come First Served (FCFS)
    2. Round Robin
    3. Shortest Process Next (SPN)
    4. Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
    5. Priority Scheduling
