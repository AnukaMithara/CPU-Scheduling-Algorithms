# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms

This is an implementation of scheduling algorithms using Processing. The assignment includes the following scheduling algorithms:

    1. First Come First Served (FCFS)
    2. Round Robin
    3. Shortest Process Next (SPN)
    4. Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
    5. Priority Scheduling

    
## CInstallation guid
    1. Install Processing: Processing is required to run the implementation of scheduling algorithms. You can download and install Processing from the official website: https://processing.org/download/
    2. Open the Project: After installing Processing, open the cloned repository as a project in the Processing IDE.
    3. Run the Algorithms: Once the project is opened, you should be able to run each scheduling algorithm using the Processing IDE.
